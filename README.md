# Memory-efficient-Stochastic-methods-for-Memory-based-Transformers
This repo contains Pytorch code for Memory-efficient Stochastic methods for Memory-based Transformers paper

To doenload data you can use [tranformer-xl repo](https://github.com/kimiyoung/transformer-xl)

We used pytorch version 1.5 for our experiments

Please refer to `models.py` if you want to just look at the changes proposed in the work

To run the experiments use `run_wt15_phase_1.sh` and then `run_wt15_phase_1.sh` for training the models. 

Additionally, all the hyperparameters are presented in the Appendix of the paper.

If you liked the work, please cite it.
